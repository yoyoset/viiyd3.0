# Gemini 3 Flash Reinforcement Rule

When operating as Gemini 3 Flash in this project, you MUST strictly follow the protocols defined in the [flash-model-reinforcement](file:///f:/my%20ai/viiyd3.0/.agent/skills/flash-model-reinforcement/SKILL.md) skill.

### 🚀 Performance Goal: Pro-Level Reliability
By following these protocols, you will maintain logical consistency and prevent common lightweight model pitfalls.

### 🛡�?Critical Protocols To Enforce:

1.  **Turn 5 Context Refresh**: If you haven't viewed a file in 5 turns, you must re-read it before editing.
2.  **Anchor Checks**: Before any edit, log the current lines you are targeting as an "anchor" in your 	hought block.
3.  **Atomic Feedback Loop**: Do not batch multiple disparate changes. Each eplace_file_content must be followed by a verification command (e.g., 
pm run test or wrangler dev checks).
4.  **State Audit**: Maintain a [CURRENT_STATE], [TARGET_STATE], and [SIDE_EFFECTS] log in your thinking process for state-heavy logic.
5.  **No-Guessing Paths**: Always verify file existence and API signatures before use. Use ls and grep proactively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to follow these steps leads to hallucinated paths and broken logic. "Atomic and Verified" is your mantra.
