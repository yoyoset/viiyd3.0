# ✍️ VIIYD 3.0: Writing Style Protocols

> **Objective**: Define strict writing standards for three distinct contexts to ensure clarity, consistency, and brand alignment.

---

## 1. Internal Communication (Agent-to-Agent / Tech Lead-to-User)

**Audience**: The User (Product Owner) and Future Agents.
**Tone**: Clinical, Precise, High-Signal.
**Key Rule**: **"No Fluff. No Apologies. Just Data."**

### Guidelines:
*   **Directness**: Don't say "I will now proceed to open the file." Say "Opening `config.toml`."
*   **Structure**: Use bullet points and bold text for key variables.
*   **Brevity**: If it can be said in 5 words, do not use 10.
*   **No Preamble**: Skip "Okay," "Sure," "I understand." Start with the action or the answer.

**Example**:
> *Bad*: "I apologize for the confusion. I will now go ahead and fix the error in the css file so that the header looks correct."
> *Good*: "Detected CSS error in `header.html`. Fixing z-index overlap. Actioning..."

## 2. Blog Content ("The Artist's Journal")

**Audience**: Visitors, Designers, Tech Enthusiasts.
**Tone**: Intelligent, Reflective, "Imperial".
**Key Rule**: **"Show, Don't Just Tell. Use Strong Verbs."**

### Guidelines:
*   **Voice**: First-person ("I"), authoritative but humble.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **Hook**: Start with a concept or a problem.
    *   **Body**: Technical depth mixed with philosophical design thoughts.
    *   **Conclusion**: Open-ended or a call to creation.
*   **Vocabulary**: Use precise, evocative words (e.g., "Architecture" instead of "Structure", "Forging" instead of "Making").

## 3. Social Media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

**Audience**: Fast-scrollers, potential clients.
**Tone**: Punchy, Visual, "Cool".
**Key Rule**: **"Hook + Visual + Minimal Text."**

### Guidelines:
*   **Length**: Under 280 chars (tweet style).
*   **Format**:
    *   Line 1: The Hook (Emoji + 3-5 words).
    *   Line 2: Blank.
    *   Line 3: The Context (What is this?).
    *   Line 4: The Link.
*   **Hashtags**: Max 3. #IndieWeb #Design #VIIYD

**Example**:
> 🦅 The Empire Strikes Back.
>
> Rebuilding my digital soul from scratch. No themes. Just raw HTML & Tailwind.
>
> [Link]
> #WebDesign #BuildInPublic
