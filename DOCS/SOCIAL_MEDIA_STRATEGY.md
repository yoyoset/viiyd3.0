## 1. Tone & Voice Guidelines

### ❌ What to AVOID (The "AI Trap")
- **Over-hyping**: "Unleash the power", "Ultimate", "Game-changer", "Masterpiece".
- **Robotic Transitions**: "In conclusion", "Dive into", "Here is the breakdown".
- **Aggressive/Hard Masculine**: "Dominate", "Destroy", "Brutal".
- **Fake Emotion**: "I am thrilled to announce", "So excited to share".

### ✅ The Target Voice ("Soft & Authentic")
- **Perspective**: First-person ("I", "My").
- **Emotion**: Honest, grounded, sharing the *process* not just the *result*.
- **Style**:
    - **Soft**: Use words like "Crafting", "Layering", "Feeling", "Mood".
    - **Feminine nuance**: Focus on aesthetics, color play, and the *feeling* of the piece, rather than just stats/lore.
    - **Conversational**: Like showing a friend a photo on your phone.

## 2. Platform Formats

### 📸 Instagram
- **Structure**: Carousel (Multi-image story).
- **Caption Style**: Short, aesthetic, diary-entry style.
- **Components**:
    - **Photo sequence guide**: Which images to put 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
    - **Caption**: The text block + Hashtags.

### 🟢 WeChat Official Account (公众号)
- **Structure**: Article / Visual Diary.
- **Copy Style**: Longer form, narrative, visually spaced out.
- **Delivery**:
    - Provide a Markdown structure that mimics the flow.
    - Title Suggestion (Not header-bait, but interesting).
    - Image Placement indicators.

## 3. Workflow

1.  **Agent**: Generates `social_media.md` in the project folder.
2.  **User**: Reviews content.
3.  **User**: Copies Text & Downloads Images.
4.  **User**: Publishes manually to Instagram/WeChat.

## 4. Example Tone Comparison

**Old (AI/Hard):**
"The Bullgryns are ready to crush the enemies of the Emperor! Check out this brutal kitbash using Necromunda parts. The conversion took 35 hours and features high-level weathering."

**New (Soft/Authentic):**
"Finally finished these three big ones. It took about 35 hours, mainly because I kept fussing over the leather straps lol.
I really wanted them to look like they've been wandering in the sandstorm for weeks, so I went heavy on the dust texture. The contrast between the Zandri Dust armor and the green lenses turned out better than I thought. 🍃
It was a quiet weekend project, just me and the brushes."
